<tr>
  <td style="white-space: nowrap"><a href="./scripps-team-presentations/Intro%20to%20TypeScript.pdf">Introduction to TypeScript</a></td>
  <td>I love TypeScript and was pitching it to replace the aging jQuery / ES5 infrastructure.</td>

<tr>
  <td style="white-space: nowrap"><a href="./scripps-team-presentations/JavaScript%20Modules.pdf">JavaScript Modules</a></td>
  <td>This was for those who were more familiar with Java, and were completely unaware the JavaScript supported modules.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td style="white-space: nowrap"><a href="./scripps-team-presentations/JavaScript%20Package%20Management.pdf">JavaScript Package Management</a></td>
  <td>We were using grunt at the time, and I wanted the teams to consider gulp. We later went with Webpack in the early 2016 reboot of all sites.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td style="white-space: nowrap"><a href="./JavaScript%20Build.pdf">JavaScript Build</a></td>
  <td>AEM is probably one of the worst products on the planet. Not the least of it's problems is that it was based on a dead language, Java Server Pages (JSP). This talk was intended to shake up the team to help them realize how bad the Front End build was in this environment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td style="white-space: nowrap"><a href="./Technical%20Debt.pdf">Technical Debt</a></td>
  <td>Presented @ Techtoberfest, in Knoxville, TN. The intention was to show how bad HTML structure and javascript compounded over time to create Technical Debt... and to show an alternative solution to the existing code.</td>
