| Topic | Description |
| :---- | :---------- |
| [Introduction to TypeScript](./scripps-team-presentations/Intro%20to%20TypeScript.pdf) | I love TypeScript and was pitching it to replace the aging jQuery / ES5 infrastructure. |
| [JavaScript Modules](./scripps-team-presentations/JavaScript%20Modules.pdf) | This was for those who were more familiar with Java, and were completely unaware the JavaScript supported modules. |
| [JavaScript Package Management](./scripps-team-presentations/JavaScript%20Package%20Management.pdf) | We were using grunt at the time, and I wanted the teams to consider gulp. We later went with Webpack in the early 2016 reboot of all sites. |
| [JavaScript Build](./JavaScript%20Build.pdf) | AEM is probably one of the worst products on the planet. Not the least of it's problems is that it was based on a dead language, Java Server Pages (JSP). This talk was intended to shake up the team to help them realize how bad the Front End build was in this environment. |
| [Technical Debt](./Technical%20Debt.pdf) | Presented @ Techtoberfest, in Knoxville, TN. The intention was to show how bad HTML structure and javascript compounded over time to create Technical Debt... and to show an alternative solution to the existing code. |
